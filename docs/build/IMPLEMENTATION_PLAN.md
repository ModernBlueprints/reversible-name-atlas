# Reversible Name Atlas — Revised Integrated Implementation Plan

Status: **ACTIVE / R7 COMPLETE — RECORDING-READY**

Amended production goal: **ACTIVE**

Revision R+0: **Saturday 18 July 2026 at 00:51:51 CEST**

Submission hold: **ACTIVE**

This is the only implementation plan. `BUILD_SPEC.md` defines product truth;
the complete amended `GOAL.md`, once explicitly activated by the user, defines
execution authority; `STATE.md` reports current observed state. This plan
defines dependency order, target signals, evidence, allowed cuts, and actual
results. Merely existing or being committed does not activate it.

## Known-good inherited baseline

The revision starts from public release commit
`827b0f6f93174d3c34aedfd98d8467a299ab2669` on `main`. The product cycle will
continue on `revision/portable-change-receipt`; `main` remains the immutable
fallback until a renewed release candidate passes and is fast-forward promoted.

Inherited evidence, not proof of any newly added requirement:

- M0–M7 completed in the first cycle.
- Decisive first-cycle commits include scaffold `f1c519d`, feature-freeze
  product `819e674`, live/replay release `d71b0b9`, clean-clone release candidate
  `b4a2dd0`, and public checkpoint `827b0f6`.
- The strict linked-package importer, deterministic family/proposal engine,
  collision/reference checks, human authority, copy-only staging, maps, reverse
  dry run, BagIt validation, replay mode, and one validated real `gpt-5.6`
  record are inherited.
- The inherited release passed 116 pytest tests, Ruff lint/format, builds,
  secret/link checks, replay/live truthfulness checks, clean-clone installation,
  and one complete verified hero transaction.
- The validated replay record has SHA-256
  `2fe0da43fe57e72043effcf13dc3a3084b8a262295e132b00109bf767f06ae00`
  and evidence fingerprint
  `0f0b0b7cf923432431e7d184c6881cb34d61a0e5caf578f87cc029494b97d830`.
  Reuse it unless the evidence/card contract materially changes.

Old M8 status:

`SUPERSEDED — FIRST-CYCLE RELEASE MATERIAL PRESERVED BUT STALE`

The first-cycle README, screenshots, narration, thumbnail, Devpost copy, and
submission package are not evidence of revised release readiness. Final
submission remains prohibited while the submission hold is active.

## Timing model fixed at activation

R+0 is the Europe/Oslo timestamp at which the user explicitly activates the
complete amended `docs/build/GOAL.md` in this primary Codex task.

At R+0 calculate:

`available_revision_hours = hours from R+0 to Tuesday 21 July 2026 at 02:00 CEST`

`planned_revision_hours = min(70, max(0, available_revision_hours - 4))`

The four hours immediately before recording readiness are contingency for
defects and release blockers, never new scope. The final 24 hours through
Wednesday 22 July 2026 at 02:00 CEST remain the submission reserve.

If `planned_revision_hours < 70`, multiply the standard anchors by
`planned_revision_hours / 70`:

| Milestone | Standard anchor |
|---|---:|
| R1 | 12/70 |
| R2 | 26/70 |
| R3 | 38/70 |
| R4 and restore gate | 52/70 |
| R5 when admitted | 60/70 |
| R6 | 68/70 |
| R7 | 70/70 |

Actual activation calculation:

- `available_revision_hours = 73.135833`;
- `planned_revision_hours = 69.135833`;
- protected contingency: `4 hours`;
- R1 target: Saturday 18 July 2026 at 12:42:57 CEST;
- R2 target: Sunday 19 July 2026 at 02:32:35 CEST;
- R3 target: Sunday 19 July 2026 at 14:23:42 CEST;
- R4 and restore-gate target: Monday 20 July 2026 at 04:13:19 CEST;
- R5 target when admitted: Monday 20 July 2026 at 12:07:24 CEST;
- R6 target: Monday 20 July 2026 at 20:01:28 CEST; and
- R7 target: Monday 20 July 2026 at 22:00:00 CEST.

Preserve milestone order and absolute boundaries. The restore gate separately
requires at least 18 actual hours remaining. Targets force integration and
simplification; they are not cancellation timers. A missed optional gate cuts
that optional feature. A missed target does not cancel required case,
staleness, binding, receipt, verifier, controlled failure, five-state flow,
proof, clean clone, or release outcomes.

## Operating rules

- The current primary Codex task is the sole primary integrator. Bounded
  subagents may handle non-overlapping work; their results require inspection
  and product-native verification.
- Build vertical outcomes. Keep the integrated application runnable after R1.
- Every milestone closes only with actual automated evidence and relevant
  visual/artifact inspection; a completion message is not proof.
- Update this plan and the short state checkpoint with observed results. Record
  only material specification deviations in `DECISIONS.md`.
- Do not reopen project discovery, adapters, a parallel scaffold, or generic
  validation infrastructure.
- After two serious failed corrections of the same defect, reassess and simplify
  the abstraction rather than applying a third symptom patch.

Pre-authorized optional cuts, in order:

1. decorative motion;
2. second theme;
3. advanced Atlas filters and nonessential metrics;
4. thumbnails and additional relationship visuals;
5. case list/rename/delete conveniences;
6. extra negative permutations; additional public verifier output formats are
   already excluded;
7. restore UI; and
8. `restore-receipt` itself, but only before the one-time restore verdict; taking
   this cut causes `CUT_BY_PREAUTHORIZED_GATE`, and a recorded `GO` makes the
   command mandatory.

Never cut case persistence, staleness detection, evidence/card/human binding,
receipt JSON, offline HTML, independent receiver verifier, the controlled
failure, five-state flow, live/replay truthfulness, clean clone, or release
hardening.

## Revised vertical delivery records

### R1 — Revision walking transaction

- **Requirements:** PRD-006, CASE-001–005, AI-007, VER-005–008, UX-006–007,
  REL-005.
- **Dependencies:** explicit goal activation; inherited `827b0f6` release and
  validated replay record.
- **Calculated target:** standard R+0–12; proportionally scaled at activation.
- **User-visible outcome:** the hero case survives a process restart, the
  inherited replay card binds to a human decision, staging emits a minimal
  receipt, a separate keyless verifier passes, the exact BagIt-valid altered
  copy blocks, and all five routes exist in plain integrated form.
- **Implementation responsibilities:** introduce one rehydratable case aggregate,
  minimal versioned persistence, decision/card binding, minimal receipt DAG,
  receiver-verifier dispatch, controlled counterfactual, and five server routes
  without visual redesign.
- **Automated checks:** focused restart/binding tests; inherited suite; valid
  bag verifier exit `0`; altered-ledger bag BagIt-pass plus verifier exit `1`;
  route and redirect tests; no provider call in replay.
- **Visual checks:** inspect one complete plain Atlas→Decide→Stage→Verify→Handoff
  transaction and truthful replay label.
- **Exact completion evidence:** committed integrated transaction; case revision
  before/after restart; receipt fingerprint; separate subprocess output; BagIt
  result and exact digest blocker for controlled failure; five route captures;
  actual test counts.
- **Downstream consumer:** R2 hardening and R3 final receipt/verifier contracts.
- **Owner:** primary integrator; bounded subagents only for frozen isolated tests
  or pure contracts.
- **Allowed cut:** styling, convenience controls, extra metrics, restore; not any
  named walking-transaction link.
- **Actual status:** `COMPLETE`.
- **Actual verification:** integrated in commit `2495a6f`. The durable hero case
  retained revision `5` across restart, finalized at revision `6`, and reused
  the exact recorded card with zero post-restart provider requests. Producer,
  copied-bag, and copied-bag-plus-source CLI checks all printed `VERIFIED` for
  receipt `c660aff8333564583456732fbc5b6d6c66ffe07f8182bb16feeb6aaf3944fcb8`.
  The role-preserving altered target
  `manualNormalization/access/CASE-010__altered__access.svg` remained BagIt
  valid while `verify-receipt` exited `1` with exactly
  `artifact_digest_mismatch:decision_ledger`. All five routes were inspected in
  the running loopback app with correct current-step, lifecycle, and recorded
  GPT labels. The corrected full suite passed 144 tests; lock check, Ruff
  lint/format, and Git whitespace checks passed. Independent review found two
  material defects, one correction pass resolved both, and the bounded recheck
  returned `GO`.

### R2 — Case and authority hardening

- **Requirements:** CASE-001–005, AI-004–007, TX-006–007, VER-009.
- **Dependencies:** verified R1 walking transaction.
- **Calculated target:** standard R+12–26; proportionally scaled at activation.
- **User-visible outcome:** restart-safe decisions behave as one durable case;
  corruption, conflicting writers, and source change produce precise blockers;
  finalized cases cannot silently change.
- **Implementation responsibilities:** strict complete schema, canonical naming,
  atomic fsync/replace, process lock, optimistic revision check, lifecycle,
  deterministic rehydration, exact staleness diff, invalidation, and global
  budget-ledger separation.
- **Automated checks:** corrupt/unknown/incomplete case; revision and lock
  conflict; all five source-change classes; binding mismatches; finalized-case
  immutability; low-risk/collision records without GPT provenance; unchanged
  reopen with zero provider requests; inherited suite.
- **Visual checks:** restart the server on the same case; inspect preserved
  decisions and exact stale-source blocker.
- **Exact completion evidence:** serialized schema examples, atomicity and lock
  tests, source-diff matrix, no-call evidence, restart capture, actual full-suite
  result.
- **Downstream consumer:** R3 immutable receipt finalization and R4 persistent UI.
- **Owner:** primary integrator; bounded persistence-test reviewer allowed.
- **Allowed cut:** case listing, rename/delete, destructive reset, reconciliation,
  and convenience UI.
- **Actual status:** `COMPLETE`.
- **Actual verification:** committed at `5949a0f`. The case strictly rebuilds
  deterministic families, proposals, evidence, cards, decisions, lifecycle,
  and final target uniqueness before use. Every mutation reloads the exact
  durable revision and bytes, re-scans and re-imports the source, rehydrates the
  runtime, and fails closed on external replacement. Added, removed, renamed,
  resized, and same-size content changes each persist an exact, path-neutral,
  terminal `stale` record; scanner/import failures persist a distinct blocker.
  Missing sources resume through explicit and default case paths. Unchanged
  restart reuses the durable card with zero provider calls and no case revision;
  source drift during the provider wait persists stale without card or decision
  authority. `handoff_ready` remains an immutable historical terminal case.
  A real stale case was restarted in the loopback server: `/` routed to Atlas,
  all five routes displayed `BLOCKED`, the exact resized member was visible,
  direct POST mutation was refused, and no decision/stage control was exposed.
  The primary final run passed `uv lock --check`, 184 pytest tests, Ruff
  lint/format, and `git diff --check`. Independent adversarial review reproduced
  and corrected five authority defects, reran the final tree, and returned
  `R2 GO`. No GPT/API call was made.

### R3 — Receipt and verifier completion

- **Requirements:** VER-005–009, AI-007, REL-005, CLAIM-003.
- **Dependencies:** verified R2 case authority and inherited deterministic proof.
- **Calculated target:** standard R+26–38; proportionally scaled at activation.
- **User-visible outcome:** the complete source-free receipt can be copied and
  independently verified offline; its HTML explains the transaction; the exact
  controlled alteration remains BagIt-valid but Name-Atlas-blocked.
- **Implementation responsibilities:** final strict schemas; path-neutral source
  and report; byte-exact original controls; canonical ReceiptCore and envelope;
  acyclic 15-step writer; offline HTML; pure source-free verifier; optional
  source comparison; stable check IDs and exit contract.
- **Automated checks:** fingerprint/raw-digest/staged-data recomputation;
  self-reference absence; moved-bag verification; sender-path scan; HTML-machine
  agreement; cross-artifact consistency; source-free and `--source` matrices;
  malformed/schema/invariant blockers; no-write verifier snapshot; controlled
  counterfactual; inherited suite.
- **Visual checks:** open offline HTML without server/network and compare its
  central facts to the machine receipt and CLI verdict.
- **Exact completion evidence:** finalized successful hero handoff, copied-bag
  subprocess result, artifact hash table, path scan, HTML capture, controlled
  failure transcript, and actual test counts.
- **Downstream consumer:** R4 workbench and restore applicability gate.
- **Owner:** primary integrator; independent bounded verifier reviewer allowed.
- **Allowed cut:** extra negative permutations only; no additional public output
  format is permitted.
- **Actual status:** `COMPLETE`.
- **Actual verification:** committed at `b59b9ef`. The receiver now rebuilds
  the strict package, deterministic families/proposals, chronological human
  actions, Meaning evidence/card authority, exact staged proof findings, maps,
  controls, payloads, summary, and offline receipt without a case, source,
  provider, network, browser, or API key. A copied hero handoff verified
  source-free and with the exact source at receipt fingerprint `69c1d00e…`; a
  separate keyless subprocess changed no bag byte. The exact altered-ledger
  copy remained BagIt-valid and blocked with only
  `artifact_digest_mismatch:decision_ledger`. Path-neutrality was scanned over
  the real hero output, post-finalization failure preserved every bag byte, and
  malformed/schema/fingerprint/digest/data/cross-artifact/source negatives
  returned stable blockers. Five independently reproduced false-positive
  attacks—pre-card decisions, two invalid collision chronologies, fabricated
  producer prose, and prohibited claim boundaries—now fail closed. The primary
  and independent final runs each passed 215 tests plus lock, Ruff lint/format,
  Python compilation, and Git whitespace checks. The Browser control surface
  declined a standalone `file://` visual open by policy; deterministic HTML
  reconstruction and static content inspection passed, and visual rendering is
  carried forward into R4's required browser QA rather than bypassing that
  policy.

### R4 — Five-state product experience

- **Requirements:** UX-004, UX-006–008, CASE-002–004, VER-007–009.
- **Dependencies:** verified R3 case/receipt/verifier transaction.
- **Calculated target:** standard R+38–52; proportionally scaled at activation.
- **User-visible outcome:** a streamlined dark Atlas, Decide, Stage, Verify, and
  Handoff workbench makes exceptions, human authority, proof, and receiver
  action immediately understandable.
- **Implementation responsibilities:** server-computed routing and guards;
  persistent shell; exception-first inspectors; progressive disclosure;
  Blueprint core `6.17.2` and icons `6.13.0` vendoring, attribution, wheel
  packaging, semantic HTML, responsive Name Atlas CSS, limited local JS.
- **Automated checks:** all routes and root transitions in every prerequisite
  state; POST guards; accessibility landmarks/labels; asset/no-CDN checks; wheel
  contents; uv-only clean install; inherited and revised suites.
- **Visual checks:** desktop recording resolution and narrow viewport; each
  route in complete and blocked states; keyboard flow, focus, contrast, status
  text, collapsed evidence, and no sender-path leakage.
- **Exact completion evidence:** route matrix, five approved captures, clean-wheel
  asset list and notice, visual/accessibility findings, actual suite results.
- **Downstream consumer:** restore gate, R6 hardening, and three-minute demo.
- **Owner:** primary integrator; bounded visual QA reviewer allowed.
- **Allowed cut:** motion, second theme, advanced filters, thumbnails, extra
  relationship visuals, case conveniences.
- **Actual status:** `COMPLETE`.
- **Actual verification:** committed at `0e7543a`. The five server-rendered
  routes now form one exception-first dark workbench with server-owned state,
  neutral GPT presentation, read-only finalized decisions, progressive
  disclosure, current-versus-historical receiver truthfulness, and responsive
  persistent case facts. Blueprint core `6.17.2`, icons `6.13.0`, the exact
  nine-icon vocabulary, Apache-2.0 license, and third-party notice are locally
  packaged with no CDN, React, Vite, Node runtime, or Node judge step. The
  corrected full suite passed 241 tests; lock, Ruff lint/format, Python
  compilation, and Git whitespace checks passed. A wheel with SHA-256
  `520cd30c29ee01a3fda176b12e7a65e8370f1ab0a643b2f6f5443a98b9b50883`
  installed in a clean Python 3.11 environment, contained all required assets,
  and served its application and styles from an unrelated working directory.
  Browser QA at 1440×900, 1000×800, and 390×844 found no horizontal overflow
  and verified truthful amber, green, and red handoff states. Independent
  adversarial review corrected the discovered authority and presentation
  defects, reverified the final tree, and returned R4 `GO` with no material
  residual defect. The correct byte-identical Blueprint CSS SHA-256 is
  `04c4dc66a0753f7256194af14f5f96f15a1a149e125898349b26c26c92ba377e`.

### Restore gate — one-time applicability decision

- **Requirements:** REL-006.
- **Dependencies:** R1–R4 complete and freshly passing.
- **Calculated target:** at R4, no later than standard R+52 or its scaled anchor.
- **User-visible outcome:** one objective decision: restore is admitted or is
  recorded `CUT_BY_PREAUTHORIZED_GATE` without ambiguity.
- **Checks:** case restart; receipt JSON/HTML; positive and controlled-negative
  receiver verification; all five routes; inherited/new core suites; no material
  cross-artifact defect; at least 18 actual hours before recording readiness.
- **Exact completion evidence:** timestamped gate table with every predicate and
  final `GO` or `CUT_BY_PREAUTHORIZED_GATE`.
- **Owner:** primary integrator; no delegation of the decision.
- **Allowed cut:** restore UI may be cut independently. Before the verdict, the
  restore command may be cut and the verdict becomes
  `CUT_BY_PREAUTHORIZED_GATE`. After a recorded `GO`, the command is mandatory
  and cannot be relabeled as a gate cut. A legitimate gate cut does not block R6
  or release.
- **Actual status:** `COMPLETE — GO`.
- **Actual verification:** evaluated once at Saturday 18 July 2026 at 04:19:07
  CEST. The verdict is monotonic: the restore command is now mandatory; only
  its UI remains independently cuttable.

  | Frozen predicate | Result | Evidence |
  |---|---|---|
  | Case persistence and restart | PASS | R2 restart/staleness matrix remains passing in the 241-test final tree |
  | Receipt JSON and offline HTML | PASS | R3 machine/HTML agreement plus R4 restart and browser inspection |
  | Positive receiver verification | PASS | copied, source-free hero receipt verification and final receiver suite |
  | Exact controlled negative | PASS | BagIt-valid altered ledger blocks only on `artifact_digest_mismatch:decision_ledger` |
  | All five routes | PASS | final route/guard matrix and browser QA at three viewport widths |
  | Inherited and revised core tests | PASS | 241/241 tests, lock, Ruff lint/format, compilation, and diff check |
  | No material cross-artifact defect | PASS | independent final R4 audit returned overall `GO` |
  | At least 18 real hours remain | PASS | 69 hours 40 minutes 52 seconds remained before recording readiness |

### R5 — Conditional restore

- **Requirements:** REL-006 and only the applicable portions of VER-009 and
  CLAIM-003.
- **Dependencies:** restore-gate `GO`.
- **Calculated target:** standard R+52–60; proportionally scaled at activation.
- **User-visible outcome:** a verified receipt can reconstruct every in-scope
  logical source-package member into a new destination, or this entire milestone
  is correctly absent after a gate cut.
- **Implementation responsibilities:** verify-first CLI, absent-destination
  guard, pending directory, reverse-map copy, byte-exact control restoration,
  strict reimport, complete path/size/hash equality, no-replace promotion,
  `restore-report.v1`; UI action only if still admitted.
- **Automated checks:** successful restore, existing destination, invalid receipt,
  copy/reimport/proof failure, source and handoff immutability, complete snapshot
  equality, no partial promotion.
- **Visual checks:** command clarity and Handoff action only if shipped.
- **Exact completion evidence:** after gate `GO`, a restore report and equality
  matrix; if the gate instead records `CUT_BY_PREAUTHORIZED_GATE`, R5 is
  inapplicable and no command/UI/docs/claim is present.
- **Downstream consumer:** R6 hardening and optional demo claim.
- **Owner:** primary integrator.
- **Allowed cut:** restore UI only after gate `GO`; there is no post-`GO` command
  cut. An admitted-command failure blocks R5 and release until corrected.
- **Actual status:** `COMPLETE`.
- **Actual verification:** committed at `b104451`. The verify-first
  `restore-receipt` command reconstructs every in-scope member through the
  receipt-bound reverse map and byte-exact original controls, strictly
  reimports the pending package, proves exact portable-snapshot equality, and
  promotes no-replace only after source-free receiver verification passes a
  second time. Its strict external `restore-report.v1` contains the complete
  successful check set and remains outside the immutable bag. The command
  dispatches before provider, budget, demo-source, or web initialization and
  uses no API key, GPT call, network, case, or browser.

  The corrected primary tree passed `uv lock --check`, 262 pytest tests, Ruff
  lint/format, Python compilation, and Git whitespace checks. An actual
  unmocked CLI restore returned `RESTORED`, reconstructed all 30 source members
  and 23,621 bytes exactly, preserved both source and handoff, and left no
  pending directory. A fresh wheel with SHA-256
  `e90e65662df87fadfcdd9c2624119bd2087de12dc9d4e74bdc5c76451b20280a`
  installed under isolated Python 3.11, exposed the verifier and restore from
  an unrelated working directory, restored the same source commitment, and
  refused a second existing destination without changing it.

  The 21-test restore matrix covers invalid input, existing and racing
  destinations, copy/reimport/proof/promotion failure, handoff mutation or
  disappearance, intermediate pending-tree symlink injection, pending-path
  replacement, late tag-file and empty-directory injection, source/handoff
  immutability, cleanup ownership, CLI dispatch, and exit contracts. One
  bounded adversarial correction replaced unsafe pathname ownership with
  descriptor/inode-bound copying and cleanup, moved the final complete handoff
  snapshot after receiver verification, and normalized the vanished-handoff
  error boundary. Independent recheck reproduced each former defect and
  returned R5 `GO`. Final Handoff QA at 1440×900 and 390×844 showed the
  exact verify-first restore guidance, no document overflow, no console errors,
  and truthful current-versus-historical receipt status.

### R6 — Feature freeze and release hardening

- **Requirements:** all required specification IDs; REL-006 only if applicable;
  REL-007; CLAIM-001–003.
- **Dependencies:** R4 plus restore cut, or R5 when admitted.
- **Calculated target:** R+52–68 without restore or R+60–68 with restore,
  proportionally scaled; optional feature freeze occurs immediately before R6
  and no later than 12 hours before recording readiness.
- **User-visible outcome:** one truthful, portable, stable release candidate with
  a clear judge path and no planned features.
- **Implementation responsibilities:** defect repair only; full proof-integrity
  audit; replay/live truthfulness; portability/path and secret scans; clean clone;
  wheel/build/license checks; accessibility/visual QA; refreshed README,
  limitations, notices/provenance, screenshots, narration, Devpost draft, and
  claims.
- **Automated checks:** lock/sync; full pytest; Ruff lint/format; build; link,
  secret, absolute-path, asset-license, and wheel-content scans; fresh copied
  hero verification; conditional restore; clean-clone replay and verifier;
  live startup and card validity without an unnecessary call.
- **Visual checks:** every route, blocked states, offline receipt, recording
  viewport, clean clone, no secrets/personal paths, refreshed screenshots.
- **Exact completion evidence:** selected candidate SHA, command transcript,
  test counts, artifact fingerprints, clean-clone record, visual audit,
  refreshed release-material paths, and claim matrix.
- **Downstream consumer:** R7 recording readiness and submission reserve.
- **Owner:** primary integrator; bounded clean-clone, visual, README, and claim
  reviewers allowed.
- **Allowed cut:** only remaining optional presentation conveniences; no required
  integrity or release surface.
- **Actual status:** `COMPLETE`.
- **Actual verification:** feature freeze began after verified R5 commit
  `b104451`; the accepted R6 candidate is
  `eb54f3a2b3ab60bc690d3151e7f5bce0ad28aa0c`. The final worktree and two
  independent reviews passed 265 tests, lock integrity, Ruff lint/format,
  Python compilation, Git whitespace, claim/link/path/secret checks, and the
  complete revised screenshot audit. The exact detached candidate passed a
  fresh Python 3.11 `uv sync --frozen`, all 265 tests, build, wheel, license,
  asset, hero, replay, and installed-wheel checks. Its wheel SHA-256 is
  `1ed641680a164196bf0fc07d894389713d0033ad28ffda27cba7253e2c0e266b`.
  A primary exact-commit transaction survived restart and independently
  verified receipt
  `9279dd11742f73518bf6a27f6a2fa41d3a15659fc3fe27592c6bf8a0499334da`;
  the BagIt-valid altered ledger blocked only on
  `artifact_digest_mismatch:decision_ledger`, and restore reproduced all 30
  members. A separate clean-clone auditor independently reproduced the same
  complete matrix with receipt
  `e68229f3cc7d3cef736823a138c3099617e4a325aaaae016e91704141b8bf5f0`
  and returned overall `GO`. Replay startup was keyless and truthful; live
  startup with no key exited `2`, while a non-secret placeholder exposed exact
  `gpt-5.6` readiness without a provider request. README, limitations, build
  log, submission copy, seven screenshots, and the code-native 3:2 submission
  thumbnail now match the frozen product and claims.

### R7 — Recording readiness

- **Requirements:** REL-007 and all applicable completion surfaces.
- **Dependencies:** verified R6 release candidate.
- **Calculated target:** standard R+68–70; proportionally scaled, ending no later
  than Tuesday 21 July 2026 at 02:00 CEST.
- **User-visible outcome:** the exact three-minute case→decision→receipt→receiver
  story is stable, rehearsed, and ready to record.
- **Implementation responsibilities:** select release commit; final clean replay
  and verifier; confirm live evidence truthfulness; finalize proof artifacts,
  screenshots, narration, shot list, Devpost draft, and `/feedback` path; make no
  planned code or design changes.
- **Automated checks:** final clean-clone judge commands and artifact fingerprints;
  repository/public revision alignment only after release acceptance.
- **Visual checks:** timed full rehearsal at capture resolution and offline
  receipt/handoff readability.
- **Exact completion evidence:** release SHA, clean status, final verification
  fingerprint, timed rehearsal duration, final materials, and zero planned work.
- **Downstream consumer:** protected submission reserve.
- **Owner:** primary integrator; user owns voice recording and `/feedback`.
- **Allowed cut:** no required release surface; restore remains absent if already
  gate-cut.
- **Actual status:** `COMPLETE`.
- **Actual verification:** the accepted product candidate is `eb54f3a`. A
  complete browser rehearsal at a 1280×720 capture viewport traversed Atlas,
  explicit low-risk approval, mechanical collision edit, the exact recorded
  GPT-5.6 card, human Meaning edit, copy-only Stage, seven-group Verify,
  Handoff, and the offline receipt with no horizontal overflow. The selected
  recording transaction has receipt fingerprint
  `2ba5d8316f970d0a8f220a57fef1b7f77c167213146eeef2639284f251f0509a`.
  Its copied handoff verified in 0.95 seconds; its ordinary-BagIt-valid altered
  ledger blocked exactly as required; and restore completed in 0.74 seconds
  with all 30 source members byte-identical and the copied handoff unchanged.
  The 0:00–2:45 visual storyboard was rehearsed at its specified shot holds;
  the 356-word narration remains a user-owned recording and timing action.
  Recording-ready release checkpoint
  `6591d57e254a21944fb0c4bdfb2f7a4eec18eda4` has parent `eb54f3a` and
  contains the final R7 documents and 3:2 thumbnail. An exact detached local
  clone passed frozen Python 3.11 sync, all 265 tests, Ruff lint/format,
  compilation, build, the unchanged wheel SHA-256, local-link checks, both
  selected-receipt verifier modes, and keyless five-route replay startup. It
  was then normally fast-forward promoted without force or history rewrite.
  A credential-disabled HTTPS clone of the public GitHub repository resolved
  exactly to `6591d57` and independently passed the same 265 tests, build,
  wheel hash, selected-receipt verification, and keyless five-route replay
  smoke. The public `main` and revision branch both contained the selected
  checkpoint before this governance-only closure. No product code, feature,
  design, screenshot, thumbnail, narration-draft, or shot-list work remains.
  The remaining work is the user-owned voice recording and `/feedback`, final
  video capture/edit/public playback, personal attestations, explicit hold
  release, and submission.

## Protected submission reserve

The final 24 hours are for the user's voice-over, final capture/edit/upload,
playback verification, `/feedback`, final rule/claim/clean-run audit, and
submission. Codex may prepare and update the Devpost draft after revised-goal
activation, but final submission is prohibited until the user explicitly
releases the active submission hold.

If every independent requirement is complete while the hold remains active, set
the phase to `WAITING_FOR_SUBMISSION_HOLD_RELEASE`, request only that release,
and preserve the completed release unchanged.

R7 is complete. The current protected-reserve boundary is the user's voice
recording and `/feedback`; `WAITING_FOR_SUBMISSION_HOLD_RELEASE` is not reached
until the final public video, due diligence, and all other pre-submission fields
are complete.

## Milestone closure protocol

For each milestone: verify dependencies; calculate its actual target; implement
the smallest complete vertical outcome; run its automated and visual checks;
record actual results and artifact/commit evidence; update `STATE.md`; and commit
coherently. If late, measure the gap, diagnose its root cause, take the next
authorized cut, restore the integrated product, and continue. Never mark a
milestone complete from elapsed time, code volume, or an agent report.
