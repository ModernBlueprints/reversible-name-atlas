## C3 evidence and verification

- Live hero root: `.name-atlas/c3-live-20260719T054119+0200`; exact
  `gpt-5.6`, returned `gpt-5.6-sol`, `store=false`, three turns, 16 evidence
  calls, zero questions, receipt
  `e3e15fb57f396760a53aecf1549cd3ecb0937cf85039e90113d29b4b1f88f9b1`,
  organized tree
  `a11ab49b9b48151aae4343c189c2eecae8c0a67a91cac45144656eb0ece02f7e`.
- Live ambiguity root:
  `.name-atlas/c3-live-ambiguity-retry-20260719T055030+0200`; exact
  `gpt-5.6`, returned `gpt-5.6-sol`, `store=false`, three turns, four evidence
  calls, exactly one question and one answer, receipt
  `9eba5c8d670106641dec8d6f6dc4366ea12454db2bd7eb8a86f27c2ca7c3b2a7`,
  organized tree
  `80d9bee46958fe996fb837c618534d29f3f0d90aad531ee18ce29ffbc1b639f6`.
- The first ambiguity attempt is preserved as failed evidence: its correct
  question cited tool-call IDs not yet accepted by the clarification evidence
  binder. A narrow correction accepts only unique observed call IDs for the one
  question; plan evidence remains content-addressed. The fresh retry passed.
- Exact sanitized recordings:
  `src/name_atlas/recordings/folder_hero_zero_question.json` SHA-256
  `75a4ab5f6bc41068c666659fb671bfbd1dcee6a24dcbbe67ba16250dca81d6a1`;
  `src/name_atlas/recordings/folder_ambiguity_one_question.json` SHA-256
  `cf8dc1ad3ad99ed99a2a10d273c713245584c89a34cf547d0a5dd9c23fdd623f`.
- Keyless proof root: `.name-atlas/c3-keyless-proof-20260719T055219+0200`.
  The hero replay, Martin receiver, and ambiguity replay all verified; Martin
  used zero provider/API/budget/external-network authority, converged to the hero
  organized tree, and reconstructed its own source exactly.
- Bundled browser replay: `.name-atlas/connected-demo/replay`; Home → Organize →
  Working → Done is truthful, 24/24 files and 23 supported links are accounted
  for, Verify again passes, and reconstruction compares exactly with the source.
  Desktop 1280×720 and narrow 390×844 have no horizontal overflow. A persisted
  job now refuses a mismatched live/replay invocation label before provider or
  budget setup.
- The final hero refusal matrix returns exact blockers for changed payload,
  changed non-destination Markdown, changed supported relationship, protected
  disagreement, and Change File fingerprint mismatch. The symmetric fixture
  blocks without guessing. A retagged BagIt-valid accepted-plan alteration is
  blocked by `artifact_digest_mismatch:accepted_plan`.
- Final focused C3/CLI correction suite: **13 passed in 12.87 seconds**.
- Complete regression: **795 passed in 46.48 seconds**.
- `uv lock --check`: **PASSED; 32 packages resolved**.
- Ruff lint: **PASSED**.
- Ruff format: **PASSED; 146 files already formatted**.
- `git diff --check`: **PASSED**.
- Independent C3 replay/privacy audit: **GO**.
- Independent C3 end-to-end/downstream audit: **GO**.

## C4 evidence and verification

- Official MCP dependency: `mcp 1.28.1` under the locked range
  `mcp>=1.27,<2`; the complete lock resolves **48 packages**.
- Required server: `uv run name-atlas mcp`; exact seven tools, strict nested
  inputs/outputs, literal planning consent, protocol-only STDOUT, STDERR
  diagnostics, local-environment credentials, and no raw filesystem, shell,
  compiler-bypass, receipt-construction, or proof-override authority.
- Durable service behavior: start/apply/answer/reconstruct idempotency binds in
  `FolderRefactorJob.v2`; identical retry returns the same authority;
  conflicting reuse blocks; status is byte-preserving; startup rehydrates
  unfinished work; clarification waits; missing-key live work defers without
  mutating the job or budget; overlapping writer ownership retries rather than
  becoming a product blocker.
- Product-native MCP root:
  `.name-atlas/c4-mcp-direct-20260719T073833+0200`; transcript SHA-256
  `0bb87409dc02376b984c122746c6d2e067b8d2a1629833787fd014a284408fa3`.
- Origin receipt:
  `5a58f7a97d6ba3d4051dbca81b1f3326d2391d1dec2dbd86865124081965eafd`;
  Change File:
  `dda994a70da9541bdd1a48a27286e7290fe440cf77bc6272edf20b219afef952`;
  receiver receipt:
  `7776d996a851ff6109aa12a6f7a8268369974fc3bf4977446f2950b43e99b2f8`;
  common organized tree:
  `a11ab49b9b48151aae4343c189c2eecae8c0a67a91cac45144656eb0ece02f7e`.
- The direct transaction proves zero-question origin, one-question origin,
  keyless differently arranged receiver application, source-free verification,
  exact receiver-local reconstruction and retry, unchanged sources, and an
  unchanged budget digest. Hero inventory preflight returned its durable handle
  in 0.033628 seconds; no fixed-latency claim applies to arbitrary payloads.
- Actual Codex MCP task: `019f78e6-06d3-72f0-9258-be362118ea2f`; it discovered
  `name_atlas`, invoked `verify_result`, and received the verified receiver
  receipt/tree above. Event-record SHA-256:
  `585f6146cf910e599b88ec0b37ed3de75c5bb0ed13aed2814e613fb8a2afa6fe`.
- Focused MCP suite: **12 passed**.
- Complete regression: **807 passed in 62.97 seconds**.
- `uv lock --check`: **PASSED; 48 packages resolved**.
- Ruff lint: **PASSED**.
- Ruff format: **PASSED; 152 files already formatted**.
- `git diff --check`: **PASSED**.
- Final independent semantic and protocol audits: **GO; no material MCP defect
  remains**.
- One-time optional Codex plugin gate: **GO**; 42 hours, 5 minutes, 11 seconds
  remained before recording readiness and 30 hours, 5 minutes, 11 seconds
  before feature freeze; the thin package is estimated below four hours and
  reuses the same MCP server.

## Credentials, budget, and inactive later surfaces

- Process `OPENAI_API_KEY`: **ABSENT; NO VALUE READ**.
- Ignored owner-only `.env.local`: **PRESENT; VALUE NOT READ OR LOADED**.
- Sole ledger: `.name-atlas/api_budget.json`, SHA-256
  `c76f578db7d571b8297b9ba48467b8680e5759979370a81c978b0d72d31edecb`.
- Ledger authority: **9/13 requests and provider attempts; USD 9.736060
  conservative committed exposure; USD 0.605515 reported estimated cost; USD 10
  cumulative cap; no second ledger**.
- Further live GPT calls: **NOT REQUIRED OR PLANNED**.
- Browser/native QA servers: **STOPPED**.
- Shared MCP implementation and direct/Codex qualification: **COMPLETE**.
- Plugin packaging, promotion, public-release, video, and submission operations:
  **NOT STARTED**.

- Active profile/current milestone: `CONNECTED_CHANGE_GO / C4 COMPLETE; PLUGIN
  GO; C5 NEXT`.
- Latest checks: `12 focused MCP; 807 full; lock; Ruff lint; Ruff format; diff;
  direct seven-tool transaction; actual Codex invocation; two final audits GO`.
- Change File/matcher/job/provenance: `C1 COMPLETE AND VERIFIED`.
- Receipt/verifier/reconstruction: `C1/C3 COMPLETE AND VERIFIED`.
- Browser/native picker: `C2/C3 COMPLETE AND VERIFIED`.
- GPT live/replay: `TWO NEW LIVE TRANSACTIONS AND TWO EXACT REPLAYS COMPLETE`.
- MCP/plugin: `COMPLETE AND VERIFIED / GATE GO; IMPLEMENTATION NOT STARTED`.
- Feature freeze/release materials: `ABSOLUTE BOUNDARY ACTIVE / STALE`.
- Submission hold: `ACTIVE`.
- Blockers: `NONE`.
- Next operation: use the official plugin-creator workflow to add one thin
  repository marketplace/plugin wrapper around the existing MCP server, then
  prove clean-clone installation, refreshed new-task discovery, installed-cache
  invocation, keyless replay, and missing-key live behavior before feature
  freeze.

## Exact next operation

`Begin C5 with the official plugin-creator workflow, implement only the thin admitted Codex plugin around the verified shared MCP server, prove installed-copy execution from a clean clone, and then enter feature freeze.`
