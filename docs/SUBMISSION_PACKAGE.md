Submission hold: **ACTIVE — DO NOT SUBMIT UNTIL THE USER EXPLICITLY RELEASES
THE HOLD**

This is the one working package for the revised demo, Devpost draft, screenshot
set, and final due-diligence pass. It is not a product specification. Its R7
status means the product, public repository, and recording materials are ready;
the actual video, user-owned fields, hold release, and submission are not.
Product truth and claim authority remain in
[`build/BUILD_SPEC.md`](build/BUILD_SPEC.md) and
[`LIMITATIONS.md`](LIMITATIONS.md).

## Crisp product case

### The problem

A linked digital object is not one filename. Its identity can also appear in an
access derivative, a preservation derivative, a metadata row, a relationship
file, paths, and manifests. A bulk rename can produce a cleaner-looking tree
while leaving those declared relationships inconsistent. Even a mechanically
valid normalization can flatten language that carried meaning.

For the supported package contract, a preservation specialist therefore needs
more than a rename preview. They need a durable record of what was reviewed,
proof that the staged package matches those decisions, and a handoff that a
receiver can verify without trusting the sender's running application.

### The solution

Reversible Name Atlas is a loopback-only migration workbench for a digital-
preservation specialist or processing archivist preparing a linked collection
for preservation or repository ingest. It converts one risky structural change
into a complete bounded transaction:

`linked source → persistent Migration Case → mechanical proposals → bounded GPT evidence where needed → human decisions → copy-only BagIt handoff → Portable Change Receipt → independent receiver verification → bounded logical restore`

The application supports one strict package shape and one fixed repository-
ready profile. That deliberate boundary makes the proof inspectable: every
source member, declared relationship, proposal, human action, staged target,
map row, and committed artifact must agree or the complete handoff blocks.

### Why the revised version matters

The proof no longer ends inside Name Atlas. The completed bag contains an
immutable path-neutral receipt, exact original control files, a complete
decision ledger, forward and reverse maps, producer verification, and an
offline human-readable receipt. A separate receiver command requires no source,
Migration Case, browser, API key, GPT, or network. It recomputes the receipt
fingerprint, committed artifact digests, staged-data commitment, package graph,
decisions, paths, references, maps, deterministic findings, and BagIt result.

The sharp demonstration is a controlled counterfactual: alter one resolved
target in the decision ledger, rebuild the ordinary BagIt tag manifest, and
standard BagIt validation still passes. Name Atlas blocks because the altered
ledger no longer matches the immutable receipt commitment. This demonstrates
receipt-bound transaction consistency. It is not a signature, sender
authentication, or protection against someone who deliberately rewrites every
artifact and issues a new internally consistent receipt.

### Potential impact

For the initial user, the value is a reviewable change-control and handoff
boundary around a consequential but bounded collection migration. The sender
can stop treating a successful batch rename as proof. A receiver can inspect the
human decisions, verify the transferred bytes and declared relationships, and,
for this supported contract, reconstruct the original logical package into a
new destination.

The Build Week release demonstrates that exact transaction. It does not claim
measured time savings, practitioner prevalence, production readiness, semantic
correctness, institutional adoption, universal archive support, or universal
reversibility.

## How the product works

### 1. Persistent Migration Case

`demo` creates or resumes a strict `migration-case.v1`. The case preserves the
source snapshot, object families, proposals, evidence packet, exact card,
human decisions, resolved targets, lifecycle, handoff pointer, and receipt
fingerprint across process restart. Every mutation reloads and revalidates the
durable case. An added, removed, renamed, resized, or content-changed source
member makes the case stale, records the exact difference, and blocks decision,
staging, and receipt mutation.

### 2. Five-state human workbench

- **Atlas** shows exceptions first while keeping every family, relationship,
  before/after path, risk, and affected reference inspectable.
- **Decide** lets the human batch-approve routine proposals, mechanically edit
  collisions without GPT, and review one Meaning exception at a time.
- **Stage** shows readiness and performs one all-or-nothing copy-only
  transaction; the source stays untouched.
- **Verify** presents one truthful verdict across Source, Payloads, References,
  Paths, Decisions, Package, and Receipt.
- **Handoff** exposes the receipt fingerprint, offline receipt, keyless verifier
  command, receiver rerun, and bounded restore command.

The shell uses locally packaged Blueprint core `6.17.2` and Blueprint icons
`6.13.0` in a dark visual system. It is server-rendered FastAPI/Jinja and
requires no client-side JavaScript; it does not use React, Vite, a CDN, or a
Node judge path.

### 3. Deterministic mechanics, bounded GPT-5.6, human authority

Deterministic code owns import, stable identity, proposals, collisions,
reference checks, decision propagation, staging, receipts, and verification.
GPT-5.6 is called only for a mechanically flagged Meaning risk and only after
the user sees and requests the bounded outbound text. The included replay is an
exact sanitized record from one real `gpt-5.6` response, bound to its model,
schema, and complete evidence fingerprint. No second provider call was made for
the revised case, receipt, verifier, interface, or restore work.

The card can present possible interpretations, possible meaning loss,
uncertainty, evidence links, and one discriminating question. It cannot approve,
edit, resolve a collision, set a final target, verify, stage, or turn anything
green. The human supplies the only semantic action.

### 4. Portable receipt and receiver verification

The sender stages copies, rewrites only declared path fields, preserves exact
original control files as receipt-bound tag files, creates inverse maps and the
complete decision ledger, runs source-aware proof, validates BagIt, finalizes a
non-circular receipt, and runs the independent receiver verifier before
no-replace promotion. Portable artifacts contain relative POSIX paths, not the
sender's local source, case, checkout, temporary, or home paths.

The receiver runs:

`uv run name-atlas verify-receipt RECEIVED_BAG`

`VERIFIED <fingerprint>` means the received transaction is internally
consistent with its committed source description. Supplying `--source` adds a
comparison to that source. Source-free verification does not prove historical
source authenticity or sender identity.

### 5. Bounded logical restore

The admitted restore verifies the handoff first, refuses an existing
destination, reconstructs content through the reverse map, restores byte-exact
original declared controls, strictly reimports the pending package, proves every
in-scope path, size, and SHA-256 against the portable snapshot, and promotes
no-replace only after every check passes:

`uv run name-atlas restore-receipt RECEIVED_BAG RESTORE_DESTINATION`

The exact permitted claim is that it reconstructs every in-scope source-package
member byte-for-byte within the supported Name Atlas package contract. It does
not restore ACLs, ownership, timestamps, extended attributes, resource forks,
undeclared references, embedded links, or arbitrary filesystem state.

## Working evidence at this draft checkpoint

- 12 hero object families;
- 28 content objects and 30 source-package members;
- original, access, and preservation derivative propagation;
- one casefold collision resolved by a human descriptor edit;
- one `campaña` → `campana` Meaning review using the exact recorded GPT-5.6
  card and a human-owned action;
- 12 explicit human decisions, including one GPT-assisted review;
- 28 complete forward/reverse map rows;
- a persistent restart-safe case and exact source-staleness blockers;
- a 30-member receipt-bound BagIt handoff;
- source-free and exact-source receiver verification after copying the bag;
- the exact BagIt-valid altered-ledger failure blocked on
  `artifact_digest_mismatch:decision_ledger`;
- verify-first logical reconstruction of all 30 source members and 23,621 bytes
  in the R5 acceptance transaction, with source and handoff unchanged; and
- 265 tests plus lock, Ruff lint/format, isolated wheel, browser, and Git
  whitespace checks on exact candidate `eb54f3a`;
- a fresh detached Python 3.11 clean clone, installed 85-entry wheel, complete
  durable transaction, copied-bag verification, controlled failure, and
  30-member restore independently returned `GO`; and
- a complete R7 browser/terminal rehearsal produced selected receipt
  `2ba5d8316f970d0a8f220a57fef1b7f77c167213146eeef2639284f251f0509a`.

The selected release was normally fast-forward promoted and a credential-
disabled HTTPS clone resolved exactly to `6591d57`. That public clone passed
frozen Python 3.11 sync, all 265 tests, Ruff, compilation, build, the unchanged
wheel hash, selected-receipt verification, and keyless five-route replay
startup. The selected recording receipt is fixed above. No product code,
feature, design, screenshot, thumbnail, narration-draft, or shot-list work
remains planned.

## Technology list

- Python 3.11;
- FastAPI and Uvicorn;
- Jinja2 server-rendered HTML;
- Pydantic v2 strict external and serialized contracts;

## Exact judge path

Prerequisites: macOS, Python 3.11, and `uv`. macOS is the tested Build Week judge
platform; Linux and Windows are not release-test claims.

From the repository root:

1. `uv sync --frozen`
2. `uv run name-atlas demo --mode replay`
3. Open <http://127.0.0.1:8000>

Replay is the stable keyless path. It uses the included synthetic hero package
and visibly labels the exact evidence-bound record **Recorded GPT-5.6
response**. It makes no API request. The application reports its case path in
the terminal and resumes that case on restart.

After producing a handoff from Stage, copy its path from Handoff and run:

- `uv run name-atlas verify-receipt RECEIVED_BAG`
- `uv run name-atlas verify-receipt RECEIVED_BAG --source sample_data/hero`
- `uv run name-atlas restore-receipt RECEIVED_BAG RESTORE_DESTINATION`

`RESTORE_DESTINATION` must not already exist.

Project checks:

- `uv run pytest`
- `uv run ruff check .`
- `uv run ruff format --check .`

Optional live startup:

- configure `OPENAI_API_KEY` only in the launching environment; then
- run `uv run name-atlas demo --mode live`.

Live mode uses exact `gpt-5.6`, substitutes no fallback, and still makes no
request until the user presses Generate on the Meaning item. Judges do not need
a key to run the complete recorded-replay transaction or either receiver
command.

## Devpost description draft

### Inspiration

A preservation migration can look successful because every renamed file exists,
while its metadata, derivatives, decision history, or receiver handoff no longer
agree. We wanted to treat the change as a reviewable transaction rather than a
batch command—and to make the proof survive after the sender closes the app.

### What it does

Reversible Name Atlas turns one strict linked digital collection into a
persistent, human-reviewed Migration Case. It previews identifier-based path
changes, keeps originals and derivatives together, exposes collisions and
possible meaning loss, and blocks the whole package until each required human
decision and deterministic invariant is complete.

It then creates a copy-only BagIt handoff with an immutable Portable Change
Receipt, exact original controls, complete decision provenance, two-way path
maps, and producer proof. A separate keyless receiver command verifies the bag
without the sender's source, case, browser, network, GPT, or API key. A bounded
restore can reconstruct every in-scope source member into a new destination.

### How we built it

The application is Python 3.11 with FastAPI, Jinja2, Pydantic v2, the official
OpenAI SDK, Library of Congress `bagit`, and locally packaged Blueprint assets.
The five-state interface is server-rendered; deterministic and human authority
never moves into browser JavaScript.

The Migration Case uses strict versioned records, atomic replace, `fsync`, a
process lock, optimistic revision matching, and exact source rehydration. The
receipt uses an acyclic canonical hash domain, raw artifact commitments, and a
complete staged-data commitment. The independent verifier strictly parses and
recomputes the transaction instead of trusting the sender's UI report.

### How GPT-5.6 is used

Deterministic mechanics first identify a Meaning risk. After the user inspects
and explicitly sends a bounded evidence packet, GPT-5.6 returns a structured
neutral card containing possible interpretations, possible meaning loss,
uncertainty, evidence links, and one discriminating question. The model cannot
approve, select a path, verify, or stage.

The repository includes one sanitized record from a real `gpt-5.6` response to
the exact hero evidence. Replay validates the model, schema, and complete
evidence fingerprint, is visibly labeled, and requires no API key. No new model
call was needed for the portable-handoff revision.

### How Codex was used

Codex with GPT-5.6 was the primary development environment and integrator. In
one primary task it translated frozen product contracts into vertical slices,
kept the application runnable, integrated bounded parallel reviews, exercised
the browser and CLI, reproduced adversarial proof failures, and converted valid
failures into regression tests.

The key decisions made explicit through that collaboration were one strict
package contract instead of a generic adapter platform; a persistent local case
as workflow authority; an immutable receipt as the handoff boundary; GPT as
advisory and the human as semantic authority; a source-free receiver verifier;
and verify-first no-overwrite restore. The dated chronology and commit evidence
are in `docs/CODEX_BUILD_LOG.md`.

### Challenges and accomplishments

The hardest problem was preventing a plausible green result. We had to separate
four authorities: the local mutable case, the complete decision ledger, the
producer verification report, and the immutable receipt. We also had to remove
receipt self-reference, keep sender-local paths out of portable artifacts,
verify a copied bag without sender state, and make restore safe against partial
promotion and path races.

The clearest accomplishment is the controlled failure: after altering the
decision ledger and rebuilding the BagIt tag manifest, ordinary BagIt still
passes, but Name Atlas identifies the exact receipt-commitment mismatch. That is
the difference between validating transferred bytes and verifying this declared
change transaction.

### What we learned

AI authority should shrink as a claim becomes more consequential. GPT-5.6 is
useful for organizing bounded ambiguity into a precise human question. It is
not the right authority for approval or proof. Human judgment and deterministic
verification complement each other only when their roles remain explicit in
the product and artifacts.

### What's next

After Build Week, the honest next work is practitioner testing, measured
workflow studies, scale characterization, and evidence-based selection of any
additional package adapter. Direct repository integration, generic policy
builders, signatures, collaboration, and AI-training-data adapters are not part
of this release.

R7 visual rehearsal status: **PASS**. The complete application sequence was
rehearsed at a 1280×720 capture viewport with the specified shot holds and no
horizontal overflow. The selected receipt, copied-bag verifier, controlled
failure, and restore commands were then rerun from the exact candidate. The
visual schedule totals 2:45. This is timing evidence for the shot plan, not a
substitute for the user's final narrated recording.

## Timed English voice-over draft

Target: **2:35–2:45** with natural pauses. The final recording must be timed
against the selected visuals; do not assume a words-per-minute estimate is
proof of duration.

### Voice-over ownership and acceptance

- Final narrator/voice recording: `[USER ACTION REQUIRED]`
- Final recorded duration: `[PENDING; must be 2:35–2:45 target and video must be under 3:00]`
- Audio intelligibility check: `[PENDING]`
- Spoken claims checked against the selected release: `[PENDING]`
- User approval of final audio: `[PENDING]`

## Capture shot list

1. Use a neutral recording workspace and the final release checkout. No personal
   paths, browser notifications, account identifiers, secrets, or private tabs.
2. Record the browser at 1920×1080 or 2560×1440 and export 1920×1080. Use the
   visually verified desktop width and a zoom level readable at normal YouTube
   playback.
3. Use replay mode. Show **Recorded GPT-5.6 response** and the model contract.
   Do not make another provider request for the recording.
4. Use one fresh hero Migration Case for the narrated transaction. Rehearse the
   exact batch approval, collision edit, Meaning card, human edit, Stage,
   Verify, and Handoff sequence before capture.
5. Prepare the copied successful handoff, controlled altered-ledger copy, and
   absent restore destination in a neutral temporary path before recording.
6. Capture terminal commands at a readable font size with no shell history or
   unrelated filesystem output. Show exact command/result pairs, not a
   prewritten imitation.
7. Show the offline receipt from the copied bag. Make clear that it is a derived
   human view and that the machine receipt/artifact commitments are authority.
8. Use a concise Codex/commit/test overlay during the final narration. The FAQ
   does not require the Codex interface on screen, but the narration must name
   concrete contributions.
9. Use no copyrighted music or third-party footage. Blueprint is part of the
   licensed product UI, not external promotional footage; retain its notices in
   the repository.
10. Export under three minutes, watch the complete local file with audio, upload
    it as Public on YouTube, then watch the complete public playback before
    adding its URL to Devpost.

All final captures must use synthetic fixture data, avoid secrets and sender-
local personal paths, preserve truthful status colors, contain no clipping or
horizontal document overflow, and match the selected release behavior.

### Devpost gallery thumbnail

Use [`submission-thumbnail.png`](submission-thumbnail.png), a code-native
1500×1000 PNG in the established dark visual system. It is 3:2, 210,124 bytes,
and has SHA-256
`1eee93fe81037843ca80453574d9f488a8aef97c0ad542ea615cfcd045a78ca0`.
The editable vector source is
[`submission-thumbnail.svg`](submission-thumbnail.svg), SHA-256
`91e1f7eff0159df6417913d3493a330ffef718857839b12e928a9cf8df1b4836`.
It contains only project-native text and vector shapes; no generated or
third-party promotional imagery is embedded. The visible `2ba5…f0509a`
fragment is the actual selected recording receipt, not illustrative evidence.

## Limitations and claim boundaries for public copy

The public description and video may say that the verified release:

- persists a human-reviewed Migration Case across restart;
- binds GPT evidence, the exact card presented, and the human's explicit action
  in the complete decision ledger;
- creates a copy-only BagIt handoff with a path-neutral Portable Change Receipt;
- independently verifies a copied receipt without source, case, browser,
  network, GPT, or API key;
- detects the exact BagIt-valid but receipt-inconsistent altered-ledger copy; and
- reconstructs every in-scope source-package member byte-for-byte within the
  supported Name Atlas package contract.

Do not claim:

- measured or percentage time savings, recurring speed, or practitioner
  prevalence;
- semantic correctness, AI safety verification, or that GPT chose the correct
  name;
- sender identity, human authorship, institutional authorization, signatures,
  or cryptographic authentication;
- historical-source authenticity from source-free verification;
- compliance, production readiness, or downstream repository acceptance;
- preservation or restoration of ACLs, ownership, timestamps, extended
  attributes, resource forks, undeclared links, embedded links, or arbitrary
  filesystem state;
- universal archival-workflow support, arbitrary schemas, universal safety, or
  universal reversibility;
- Archivematica certification, compatibility, or live integration;
- AI-training-data readiness, institutional adoption, proven superiority over
  ordinary Codex, absence of competitors, or a proven probability of winning.

## Claim-to-evidence audit

| Public claim | Required evidence before use | Draft status |
|---|---|---|
| Persistent restart-safe case | Restart test and exact case/card/decision rehydration | Verified at R2 and in the 265-test R6 suite |
| Source change blocks | Added/removed/renamed/resized/content-changed matrix and UI blocker | Verified at R2 and in the 265-test R6 suite |
| Portable path-neutral receipt | Artifact schema/path scan, fingerprint, raw digest and staged-data recomputation | Verified at R3 and in the R6 candidate path scan |
| Independent keyless verification | Copied-bag subprocess with API key absent and bag byte snapshot | Verified at R3/R5 and twice from exact detached `eb54f3a` clean clones |
| BagIt-valid altered ledger blocks | BagIt pass plus exit `1` and exact `artifact_digest_mismatch:decision_ledger` | Verified at R1/R3 and reverified in R6; final screenshot records the exact Name Atlas blocker |
| Five-state coherent experience | Route/guard matrix and browser QA at recording and narrow widths | Verified at R4/R5 and final R6 screenshot/narrow QA |
| Bounded restore | Verify-first unmocked restore, exact 30-member snapshot equality, no overwrite, source/handoff unchanged | Verified at R5 and twice from exact detached `eb54f3a` clean clones |
| Real GPT-5.6 card | Canonical record SHA, evidence fingerprint, usage, and live/replay build evidence | Verified; no new call made or needed |
| 265 passing tests | Fresh R6 release-hardening full-suite output | Verified by the primary integrator after the final path-selection correction |
| Final public release | Selected SHA, clean branch, public alignment, credential-disabled HTTPS clone | Verified at `6591d57`; closure changes only evidence/status documents, not the selected product or media |
| Final video and submission | Public playback, `/feedback`, personal attestations, explicit hold release, Devpost receipt | `[USER ACTIONS AND FINAL CLOSURE PENDING]` |

## Final stop rule

Preparing or committing this draft does not authorize submission. If every
independent product and media requirement is complete while the submission hold
remains active, the correct state is
`WAITING_FOR_SUBMISSION_HOLD_RELEASE`. Final Devpost submission remains
prohibited until the user explicitly releases that hold.
